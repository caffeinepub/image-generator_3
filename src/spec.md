# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Add a Replicate API token constant to the backend for authentication purposes.

**Planned changes:**
- Add a constant named 'token' with the value 'HIER_DEIN_TOKEN' to backend/main.mo

**User-visible outcome:** No user-facing changes; this is a backend configuration change that prepares the application for Replicate API integration.
